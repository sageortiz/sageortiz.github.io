<p>VoIP phones and the routers depend upon mains electricity for power, unlike PSTN phones, which are provided with power from the telephone exchange However, this can be reduced by installing a UPS The Power over Ethernet interface simplifies this exceptionally because power can be "injected" at any connector (especially in passive mode where all gadgets are drawing the very same voltage) or at the router.</p>
