<p>Still, with a lot choice offered, and with so much lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be tough to understand where to begin. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and hassle-free; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business needs to comply with security policies that need information to be saved on-site, then a hosted solution is probably not the best option. The only difference between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost of today's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the standard phone networks (the standard phone lines) rather of the Internet (as is the case with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>The VoIP system we offer is hosted, implying the PBX element is kept in a safe and secure data centre. VoIP gives you the capability to utilize your smart device as an extension of the business phone system. There is also an IP (internet protocol) PBX alternative, which transforms phone calls into small data plans and sends them over a computer system network instead of a physical phone line.</p>
