<p>Still, with so much option available, and with so much lingo surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be tough to know where to begin. While Digital Phone Systems are hassle-free and practical; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business must abide by security guidelines that need data to be saved on-site, then a hosted option is most likely not the best option.
